Explanation of the Project Execution:

Just check the paths of the CSV File and Groups.txt file in the code.
Direct them to the respective files.

We can execute the code in Any IDE directly. Just run the file.
At the end we can see all the plots generated at each eps value their different "r" threshold values 
and their respective IOU Values.

"or"

we can also execute the file in cmd.

"path to the folder">python Project_final.py.  Executing this will excute the complete file.
Executing the code in cmd generates the plots in sequential manner. You need to close one plot to see 
the next plot. In total there are 30 plots for 30 different eps_values.


Total execution run time for the code is approximaytely 6 minutes. 
At different eps_values ranging from 0.1 to 3.0
